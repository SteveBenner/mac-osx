# Mac OS X Scripts

### AppleScripts
Place the contents of this directory in `/Users/<username>/Library` to use

- `toggle-function-keys`

    Toggles operation of function keys between special keyboard actions, (such as volume controls) and normal function keys. Helpful for smaller keyboards.
- `resize-rhosimulator-iphone`

    Automatically resizes the RhoSimulator iPhone window at application start.

### Automator workflows
I use these workflows to create contextual menu services for handy tasks like compression. Place the contents of this directory in `/Users/<username>/Library` to use

- `Scan-with-DaisyDisk`

    Opens the folder in DaisyDisk, a gorgeous app for disk space management.
- `Tar-and-Gzip`

    Creates a TAR archive of the folder or file with gzip compression (in the same directory).
