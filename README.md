# macOS scripts
This is my personal collection of scripts and Automator Workflows for use on macOS systems.

To install, place `.scpt` files in `~/Library/Scripts/`.

- `toggle-function-keys`

    Toggles keyboard mode between *F1-F12* and special function keys.
- `resize-rhosimulator-iphone`

    Automatically resizes the [RhoMobile](http://rhomobile.com/) [RhoSimulator](http://docs.rhomobile.com/en/2.2.0/rhodes/simulator) iPhone window at application start. Used for testing and development of cross-platform apps.

## Automator Workflows
Various contextual menu services. To install, place `.workflow` files in `~/Library/Services/`.

    Opens a folder in [DaisyDisk](http://www.daisydiskapp.com/), a gorgeous app for disk space management.

    Creates a 'tarball' (a TAR archive compressed using gzip) from selected file or folder in the current working directory.
    
- `Open-in-Sublime-2`

    Opens a folder in Sublime Text 2, in a new project window, and opens the `find` panel.
